This is a swing/jdbc example.

To try it, (compile and) load table-gen.lisp and table.lisp
(you need to modify it a bit first if you're not using PostgreSQL), in
this order, then do

(table:create-and-show-gui "select * from <your table here>")

The cells are editable, so don't try it on an important db table.
